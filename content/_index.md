## Introduction

The PhpDrone organisation aims a providing unified resources and plugins
towards usage of Drone for PHP continuous integration, delivery and deployment.

### SDKs

Two SDKs are currently maintained, one for client and one for plugins.

### Plugins

We are providing multiple dedicated Drone plugins, both aimed toward PHP or 
written in PHP.

### Docker images

Docker images are also provided for other tasks, eg, an nginx web server,
a [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) Docker image
